# Reporting Security Issues

The Armor team and community take security bugs in our platform and products seriously. We appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [security.oss@armor.com](mailto:security.oss@armor.com) and include the
word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The Armor team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your
report, the security team will investigate â€“ providing a timeline and periodic updates as we work towards a resolution,
including the release of a fix and a full announcement. Additionally, we may reach out and ask for additional
information or guidance, so please include your preferred method of contact in the initial report.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a
vulnerability through the various package registries' responsible reporting processes.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will
coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible to the
  project(s) respective package registries.
